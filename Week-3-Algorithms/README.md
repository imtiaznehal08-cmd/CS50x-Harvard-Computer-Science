**Week 3: Algorithms**
This directory contains my solutions for the Week 3 problem sets of Harvard's CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science. These projects explore computational complexity, search and sort algorithms, and the implementation of varied voting systems using structured data.

🛠 **Skills Demonstrated**
Algorithm Analysis: Identifying O(n 
2
 ) vs. O(nlogn) behaviors through empirical timing data.

Structured Data: Defining and manipulating custom typedef struct objects to manage complex datasets like candidate profiles.

Logic: Implementing nested loops for ranked-choice tabulation and tie-breaking conditions.

Efficiency: Comparing the trade-offs between Bubble, Selection, and Merge Sort.

**Projects Overview**
**Sort**
A "black box" analysis of three different compiled binaries to identify their underlying sorting algorithms.

Key Concept: Using the Big O notation to predict how an algorithm scales as input size increases.

Logic: By running time ./sort on random, sorted, and reversed files of 5,000, 10,000, and 50,000 lines, I identified Sort 1 as Bubble Sort, Sort 2 as Merge Sort, and Sort 3 as Selection Sort based on their execution times.

**Plurality**
An implementation of a simple plurality (first-past-the-post) election system.

Key Concept: Searching through an array of structs and tracking vote counts.

Logic: The vote function uses strcmp to find a candidate and increment their total. The print_winner function identifies the highest vote count and prints all candidates matching that score to handle ties.

**Runoff**
A program that simulates a ranked-choice runoff election.

Key Concept: 2D arrays (preferences[voter][rank]) and recursive-style elimination logic.

Logic: The program tabulates the top-choice for each voter, eliminating the candidate with the fewest votes in each round until a majority winner is found or a tie is declared.

**How to Compile and Run**
Ensure you have the cs50 library installed in your environment.

1. **Compile the code**:

make plurality
make runoff
2. Execute the programs:

./plurality Alice Bob Charlie
./runoff Alice Bob Charlie
3. Testing Sort (empirical analysis):

cd sort
time ./sort1 random50000.txt

**Learning Outcomes**
Analyzed time complexity to distinguish between different sorting methodologies.
Utilized structs to create cohesive data units that store names, votes, and status flags.
Implemented tie-handling logic in multiple voting scenarios to ensure fair election results.
